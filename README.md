# Citi-Bike
Citi Bike is a bike-sharing program in New York City that allows people to rent bicycles for short periods. Launched in 2013 and operated by Lyft (formerly Motivate International), the program features bike stations scattered across the city. Users can purchase passes or memberships, enabling them to unlock bikes, use them for a specified duration, and then return them to any Citi Bike station. This initiative promotes sustainable and convenient urban transportation, reducing traffic congestion and fostering a healthier mode of commuting.
# Objective
The objective of analyzing the Citi Bike project in NYC is to evaluate its impact and effectiveness in promoting sustainable urban transportation. This analysis assesses ridership patterns, usage trends, system expansion, user demographics, environmental benefits, public health impacts, and integration with existing transportation infrastructure. Ultimately, it aims to provide insights to optimize the bike-sharing program, enhance urban planning, address equity concerns, and contribute to a more efficient and accessible transportation system in New York City.
